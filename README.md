# Java Programming Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains Java code implementations for various programming exercises. Each exercise is organized into separate Java classes, along with a test class to demonstrate functionality.

## Exercises

### Triangle Class
- Creates a `Triangle` class extending `GeometricObject`.
- Implements methods for calculating area, perimeter, and string representation.
- Includes a test program for usage.

### IllegalTriangleException
- Defines an `IllegalTriangleException` for handling invalid triangle side lengths.
- Modifies the `Triangle` class to throw this exception when necessary.

### Processing Scores from a Text File
- Reads scores from a specified URL.
- Calculates total, average, and sorts scores in ascending order.
- Displays the results.

### Colorable Interface and Square Class
- Defines a `Colorable` interface with a `howToColor()` method.
- Creates a `Square` class extending `GeometricObject` and implementing `Colorable`.
- Implements the `howToColor()` method for the `Square` class.
- Includes a test program to demonstrate colorable object usage.
